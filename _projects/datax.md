<!-- ## DataX: Exploring Justice-Oriented Data Science with Secondary School Students -->
<br />

DataX is [an NSF DRK-12 project](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2101413) that aims to develop an integrated, justice-oriented curriculum and a digital platform for teaching secondary students.

## Introduction

> Understanding data is critical for informed citizens. Data science is a growing and emerging field that can incorporate statistics, mathematics, and computer science to develop disciplinary knowledge and address societal challenges. This project will develop an integrated, justice-oriented curriculum and a digital platform for teaching secondary students about data science in science and social studies classrooms. The platform will help students learn about data science using real-world data sets and problems. This project includes science and social studies teachers in the design of the resources and in testing them in secondary school classrooms. Research and development in data science education is needed to understand how students can learn more about the use of data in meaningful and authentic ways. This interdisciplinary project will also help students meaningfully analyze real-world data sets, interpret social phenomena, and engage in social change.
> 
> During a two-year project period, we aim to iteratively advance three design components of the DataX program: (a) a justice-oriented data science curriculum integrated in secondary science and social studies; (b) a web-based learning platform that extends the Common Online Data Analysis Platform (CODAP) to support collaboration and sophisticated data practices; and (c) pedagogical practices that involve learners to work collectively as community. The guiding research question is: What scaffolds and resources are necessary to support the co-development of data, disciplinary, and critical literacies in secondary classrooms? To address this, the project will use participatory design research with science and social studies teachers to develop and test the curriculum, the learning platform, and the pedagogical practices. The data collected will include qualitative sources gathered from participatory design workshops and classrooms, as well as quantitative data from questionnaires and system logs. Using the data, we examine students' data science skills, data dispositions, and social participation in collaborative data investigations.

## Phase 1 (2021-2022)

(More soon...)

## Prior Work

Computing has become an integral part of the practice of modern science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), inspiring educators to integrate computing with STEM learning. This project aims to develop a pedagogical model -- *Data Expedition* or *DataX* -- to engage students in building scientific explanations based on real-world open science data, computing, and classroom dialogues. DataX would not only nurture crucial scientific practices emphasized by the Next Generation Science Standards, but also make science learning more connected with real-world problems and aligned with real-world scientific practices.

### Early Exploration (May 2018)

The initial phase of the project was supported by the University of Minnesota Libraries, under its [Research Sprints program](https://www.lib.umn.edu/research-sprints).
During the research sprint, a project team -- made of geospatial data curators, data scientists, and instructional designers -- worked together to identify, retrieve, and preserve a set of open geoscience data to support data expeditions to the Arctic and Antarctic. Over the span of 4 days, we have:

- Drafted curriculum-relevant inquiry questions related to the climate change
- Compiled dozens of open datasets related to the climate change
- Cleaned a subset of the identified datasets (appx. 12) and created a data wrangling/cleaning guide for future use
- Imported 8 datasets to the [Common Online Data
Analysis Platform (CODAP)](https://codap.concord.org/) for data expeditions and created 3 'data stories' from these expeditions
- Developed a mockup for the DataExpedition environment
- Created a preliminary pedagogical design for DataExpedition in high school science

Special thanks to the awesome project team -- Mariya Gyendina (PM), Lindsay Matts-Benson, Carolyn Rauber, Melinda Kernik, Danny Hanson, Ryan Mattke, and Frank Sayre -- who brought tremendous expertise, curiosity, and willingness to play.
### Prototype Design and Pilots (Jan 2019 - Jun 2020)

The project is supported by the Grant-in-Aid (GIA) initiative of the Office of the Vice President for Research, University of Minnesota. 



#### Co-design with teachers

In this phase, we are co-designing pedagogical interventions with K-12 teachers.

Partner schools include:

- Central High School, St Paul
- Harding High School, St Paul
- Jackman Institute of Child Study Lab School, Toronto

#### DataX platform

We are also developing a DataX platform that supports learners' computational participation across disciplines. Below is a screenshot of the platform we are currently developing.
