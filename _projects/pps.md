This project will focus on [Baba is You](https://hempuli.com/baba/), a challenging, elegant, and fun puzzle game, as a context for developing a problem solving measurement tool and a general purpose dialogic scaffolding framework that can be used by instructors and parents to understand and deepen studentsâ€™ problem solving practices. Baba Is You provides an auspicious context for this work because participants visibly interact with the rules on the screen, have to question/re-shape the goal (a real-world problem-solving constraint), rewind without a cost when the avatar dies, and advance through the game building on past skills.
