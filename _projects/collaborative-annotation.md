## Synopsis

Social annotation is a genre of information technology that allows a user to annotate information in a shared document and anchor a discussion to the annotated information. When it is used socially in online classrooms, web annotation can support social reading, group sensemaking, knowledge construction, community building, and collaborative learning. 

To support several instructors’ pivot to online teaching since Fall 2020, we conducted the study that was focused on engaging undergraduate students in reading and discussing course materials in online classes through collaborative social annotation activities. Following a co-design approach, we have been working closely with instructors to design a generic scaffolding framework for social annotation activities and support them to implement the framework, with course-specific customizations, in their classes. All participating courses are piloting a web annotation tool named [Hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/) that allows students to read and annotate socially.

- We participated the [Liquid Margin](https://web.hypothes.is/liquid-margins/), a show gathers talk about collaborative social annotion hosted by Hypothes.is to share our practice and research. In this eposide, we focused on how learning scientists and instructors can partner to successfully implement and use social annotation in diverse disciplines across higher education.
