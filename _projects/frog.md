The purpose of this project is to examine the extent to which *Orchestration Graphs* (Dillenbourg, 2015) could facilitate productive collaboration in online classes. 

Orchestration Graph is one of the most recent innovations to support collaboration in the digital learning contexts. In an Orchestration Graph, the vertices/nodes represent learning activities and the edges/links capture the pedagogical relationship between activities, individual, team, and class-wide activities (Dillenbourg, 2015). Student generated data are captured during activities and the graph would specify how these data may feed into later activities in sophisticated ways. An open-source technology, [FROG](https://github.com/chili-epfl/FROG), has been developed to support the authoring and execution of Orchestration Graphs. It has been piloted in nascent educational contexts such as massive open online courses (MOOCs; Haklev et al., 2017) and has demonstrated promise in facilitating rich collaboration activities.

Using Orchestration Graphs and FROG, this project has two main goals:

1. To integrate asynchronous *social annotation* activities (powered by [Hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is/)) in synchronous class meetings (in Zoom)
2. To investigate learner collaboration that spans across time and space
