WordWhispers is designed to bootstrap vocabulary development and hereafter to facilitate collective conceptual engagement in knowledge-building communities. The major functionality implemented in WordWhispers turns current conceptual artifacts (in the form of Knowledge Forum notes) into resources for ongoing written discourse, by feeding relevant terms mined from current artifacts to writers in real-time. The development of WordWhispers was funded by the [Center for Writing](http://writing.umn.edu/) at the University of Minnesota.
