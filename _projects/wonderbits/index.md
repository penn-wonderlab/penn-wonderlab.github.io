Wonderbits is a collaborative environment for growing ideas, *bit by bit*.

It is inspired by a range of digital tools, including foundational learning technologies like Knowledge Forum; recent 'tools for thought' like Obsidian and Tana; collaborative canvases like Miro, FigJam, and tldraw; and cutting-edge designs for human-AI collaboration.

The design philosophy guiding Wonderbits is to cultivate a sense of 'dwelling'—feeling genuinely at home when we wonder about ideas and try to advance them, by ourselves or with others.

Another important principle is that every person should have a say about how they work with their ideas and peers—in other words, 'infrastructure' their own knowledge building environments—so Wonderbits needs to adapt to them, rather than the other way around. People who dwell in Wonderbits are not *users*, but *designers*, *builders*, and *architects* who take an active role in shaping their environments.

At this stage, Wonderbits provides basic features to get everyone started, such as *space* (private & shared), *page*, *node*, *edge*, *cluster*, *semantic zoom*, *semantic clusters* (automatically computed), *document* view, etc. It also has a range of advanced features, such as dynamic views, levels, Thinking Lab, for those who are eager for more.

Wonderbits is already equipped with several 'AI helpers'—Glint, Buzz, Shimmer, and Pip—each with distinct talents that inject 'old AI' (deterministic analytics) into 'new AI' workflows (stochastic, generative). But the ultimate goal is that students and educators should be able to build their own AI helpers.

This is only the beginning.
