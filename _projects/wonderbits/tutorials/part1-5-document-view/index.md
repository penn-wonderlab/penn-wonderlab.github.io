While the Canvas view is great for spatial organization, sometimes you want to see your ideas in a linear format. That's where **Document View** comes in.

## When to Use Each View

### Canvas View is For Active Work with Ideas, including:

- Brainstorming and free-form thinking
- Seeing spatial relationships between ideas
- Organizing ideas into clusters
- Getting an overview of your thinking

### Document View is for Reviewing Ideas, including:

- Reading through ideas in sequence
- Following threads of connected thoughts
- Preparing to write or present
- Sharing a narrative with others
- Viewing content on a small mobile screen

## Toggling Back and Forth

You can switch between views at any time. Your ideas remain the same - only the presentation changes.

In the Document view, you can also click on a node to return to the Canvas view.

When switching back to Canvas view, the node is centered and selected.

There are many other ways to toggle between these two modes, which will be covered in Intermediate or Advanced topics.

> **Tip:** Use Canvas view for writing, exploration, and organization, then switch to Document view when you want to read through your ideas linearly.
