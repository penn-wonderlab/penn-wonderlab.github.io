### Objectives

The project integrates established disciplinary literacy frameworks with AI capabilities to create **InkSpire**. Through a
pilot study in college-level science classrooms, we will investigate how this AI-enhanced approach
affects instructors' design practices and students' reading engagement, skills, and dispositions.
