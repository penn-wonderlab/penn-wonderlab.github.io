### Overview

CraftPad is presented as a counter argument against efficiency-centric dialogues on AI in education. It re-centers educator expertise and judgment, with a focus on supporting teacher design of *Knowledge Building* (KB) lessons or classrooms.

Designing effective environments for knowledge building represents a sophisticated craft that demands deep understanding of KB principles, careful balancing of structure and emergence, and a design-oriented mindset. While generative AI has gained popularity in supporting teacher lesson planning, current systems—even the most advanced ones—operate within rigid templates that constrain teacher agency. These limitations prevent educators from engaging in the skilled, iterative actions essential to the craft of teaching.

Our work adopts an alternative approach that positions teachers as designers---rather than mere end-users---of AI tools. This perspective necessitates "meta-design"—designing for design itself—which empowers educators to configure and adapt tools in service of their professional craft and educational aspirations. By centering teachers' expertise and creative agency, we aim to develop AI-enhanced environments that genuinely support the complex, nuanced work of knowledge building design.

### Design

Departing from these perspectives, we design CraftPad as a flexible workspace that centers teachers' expertise and creative agency. CraftPad features: (1) an infinite canvas (similar to Knowledge Forum) providing space for open-ended ideation and flexible organization; (2) an embedded prompt library informed by KB principles to guide various AI generation tasks in support of teacher design; and (3) a flexible workflow enabling teachers to quickly initiate designs, iteratively refine specific components with their professional input, and compile design artifacts (e.g., lesson designs) that incorporate AI-generated content while preserving the primacy of teacher judgment. This approach embodies our meta-design philosophy by supporting teachers as designers rather than mere consumers of AI outputs.
