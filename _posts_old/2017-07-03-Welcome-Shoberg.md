Jonathan Shoberg, an undergraduate student studying computer science at UMN, will join our group this summer to work on the NSF-funded Discow project. Jon has been an active member in the Learning Sciences reading group convened by Drs. Keisha Varma and Bodong Chen. We look forward to his contributions to this project.

Below is a short bio of Jon:

> I am an undergraduate student studying computer science at the College of Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota, with a focus in Human-Computer Interaction. I am interested in using technology in new and innovative ways to enhance learning experiences, and I have a particular interest in using video games for this purpose. In my studies, I have found that I have a passion for both technology and psychology, and I try to keep both of these things in mind in my work, to come up with the best solution possible for both the user and the software.
