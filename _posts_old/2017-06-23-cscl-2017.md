Dr. Bodong Chen and Tianhui Huang attended [CSCL 2017](https://cscl17.wordpress.com/) in Philadelphia during the past week. CSCL is a flagship conference under the [International Society of the Learning Sciences](https://www.isls.org/). During the conference, Dr. Chen co-chaired [a half-day workshop](https://cpeas-cscl.github.io/), co-organized the New Members Session, [presented in a symposium](https://bookdown.org/chen/dna-cscl2017/cscl17.html), and [served as a discussant in a paper session related to learning analytics](https://www.slideshare.net/dirkchen/cscl17-discussant-learning-analytics-and-intelligent-support). Tianhui actively interacted with CSCL scholars from around the world and shared informally about her recent recent work on the 'rich club phenomenon' in online discourse. We also had a lot of fun hang out with CEHD friends/colleagues attending the conference.
