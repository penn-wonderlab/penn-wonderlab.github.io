    bio: "PhD candidate in Learning Technologies"
        # PhD Candidate in Learning Technologies program in the University of Minnesota. My research centers on learners’ online learning engagement as well as instructors’ online pedagogy development. I use social network analysis, content analysis and discourse analysis to analyze online interaction, participation, and collaborative learning. I have taught computer science courses in a Chinese university for 6 years, and currently teach undergraduate-level online courses of learning technologies and tools in education and business in the University of Minnesota.

    bio: "PhD student in STEM Education"
      # I am a PhD student in STEM Education, with a focus on diverse cultural perspectives in STEM learning and a supporting minor in Learning Technologies. My research interests include exploring collaborative relationships between families/communities and education, and utilizing various technologies towards such equitable collaborations. I completed my undergraduate degree in Chemistry/Philosophy, and my master’s degree in Geochemistry. I taught 8th grade science for five years in a highly diverse middle school with the Chicago Public Schools. I also taught Geology courses with Northwestern University’s School of Continuing Education for four years. I hope to integrate my experiences with teaching and learning, while working with families and educators towards better understanding factors that influence STEM engagement, opportunities, and outcomes.
