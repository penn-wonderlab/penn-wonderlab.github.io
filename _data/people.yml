    bio: "PhD student in STEM Education"
      # I am a PhD student in STEM Education, with a focus on diverse cultural perspectives in STEM learning and a supporting minor in Learning Technologies. My research interests include exploring collaborative relationships between families/communities and education, and utilizing various technologies towards such equitable collaborations. I completed my undergraduate degree in Chemistry/Philosophy, and my master’s degree in Geochemistry. I taught 8th grade science for five years in a highly diverse middle school with the Chicago Public Schools. I also taught Geology courses with Northwestern University’s School of Continuing Education for four years. I hope to integrate my experiences with teaching and learning, while working with families and educators towards better understanding factors that influence STEM engagement, opportunities, and outcomes.

      # I am an undergraduate student studying computer science at the College of Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota, with a focus in Human-Computer Interaction. I am interested in using technology in new and innovative ways to enhance learning experiences, and I have a particular interest in using video games for this purpose. In my studies, I have found that I have a passion for both technology and psychology, and I try to keep both of these things in mind in my work, to come up with the best solution possible for both the user and the software.
